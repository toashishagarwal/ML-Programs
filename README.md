This project contains ML-assignments for different business use-cases

a) <b>Distance Metrics</b> <br>
Program to calculate different distances like Euclidean, Manhattan & Hamming. These distances are foundational in ML to find anomalies.   <br> 
i. <b>Euclidean Distance</b> <br>
This is the straight-line distance between two points - like measuring with a ruler. It's what we usually think of as "distance" in everyday life.
Think of it as: "As the crow flies" distance between two points. <br><br>
ii. <b>Manhattan Distance</b> <br>
Also called "taxicab distance" or "city block distance," this measures distance as if you're walking along city blocks - you can only move horizontally or vertically, not diagonally.
Think of it as: Walking distance in a grid-based city like Manhattan, where you must follow streets rather than cut diagonally through buildings. <br><br>
iii. <b>Hamming Distance</b> <br>
This counts the number of positions at which two sequences differ. It's used for categorical data, strings, or binary vectors.
Think of it as: Counting how many characters you need to change to transform one string into another.

1. ## [Churn Predictor](https://github.com/toashishagarwal/ML-Programs/tree/main/ChurnPredictor) ##
Predicts whether a telecom subscriber will churn or not. It uses XGBoost algorithm. XGBoost works well on classification problem based on historical data in tabular format.
Efforts can be made to retain subscribers that are likely to churn via special campaigns or discounts. 

2. ## [Customer Segmentation](https://github.com/toashishagarwal/ML-Programs/tree/main/CustomerSegmentation) ##
Segments the ecommerce customer based on RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) features and clustering techniques. Then separate campaigns can be run for each of those segments to increase the business
